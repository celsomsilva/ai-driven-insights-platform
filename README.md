# AI-Driven Insights Platform

An **end-to-end Data Science, Machine Learning, and MLOps platform** designed to showcase expertise in **advanced statistics, predictive modeling, generative AI, data governance, and production deployment**.  

This repository demonstrates how to turn **raw data into business intelligence**, combining **technical rigor** with **real business impact**.

---


## Status
Work in progress — each stage will be documented to reflect **real-world Data Science, ML, and MLOps practices**.  

 
---


## Goals
- Analyze large-scale datasets to identify patterns and opportunities.  
- Build and deploy predictive models (supervised and unsupervised).  
- Leverage **Deep Learning** and **Generative AI** for advanced insights.  
- Apply **MLOps best practices**: pipelines, CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud deployment.  
- Ensure **data quality, governance, and explainability**.  
- Deliver insights through **dashboards and storytelling**.

## Tech Stack

**Core**  
- Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost  
- Deep Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras  
- Statistics: statsmodels, causal inference libraries  
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  

**MLOps & Infra**  
- Pipelines: MLflow, Prefect/Airflow  
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions  
- Deployment: Docker + FastAPI/Streamlit  
- Monitoring: EvidentlyAI
